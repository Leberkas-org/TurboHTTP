# Feature 001: Unified Connection Management

## Introduction

Replace the 5-class actor hierarchy (`PoolRouter` → `HostPool` → `Http1/2/3ConnectionActor` → `ClientManager` → `ClientRunner`) with a unified, non-actor `ConnectionPool` + `DirectConnectionFactory`. The new design provides the exact same feature set — per-host pooling, keep-alive reuse, HTTP/2 multiplexing, HTTP/3 QUIC multi-stream, idle eviction, MRU selection, metrics, diagnostics — with 0 actor mailbox hops for connection acquisition.

### Architecture Context

- **Vision alignment:** Eliminates the root cause of HTTP/1.0 integration test flakiness (6 actor mailbox hops add non-deterministic scheduling latency under load). Makes the connection path deterministic and fast.
- **Components involved:**
  - `ConnectionStage` (Transport/) — the GraphStage that bridges Akka.Streams ↔ TCP. Currently depends on `IActorRef poolRouter` → will depend on `ConnectionPool` instead.
  - `ClientByteMover` (Transport/) — static async tasks for TCP↔Channel pumping. Currently takes `IActorRef runner` for lifecycle → will get `Action onClose` overloads.
  - `ProtocolCoreGraphBuilder` + `Engine` (Streams/) — pipeline wiring. Currently passes `IActorRef poolRouter` → will pass `ConnectionPool`.
  - `TurboClientStreamManager` (Client/) — owns the Akka stream lifecycle. Will also own `ConnectionPool` lifetime.
  - All files in `Pooling/` — **replaced and deleted**.
  - `ClientManager.cs`, `ClientRunner.cs` (Transport/) — **replaced and deleted**.
- **New components:**
  - `ConnectionPool` — thread-safe async pool with nested `HostConnections` per host:port
  - `ConnectionLease` — wraps `ConnectionHandle` + `ClientState` + lifecycle + metrics
  - `DirectConnectionFactory` — static factory: `TcpOptions` → `ConnectionLease` (async, no actors)
  - `QuicConnectionManager` — replaces `Http3ConnectionActor` for QUIC multi-stream
- **Architectural update needed:** CLAUDE.md Pooling Layer section must be rewritten after completion.

## Goals

- Reduce connection acquisition from 6 actor mailbox hops to 0 for all HTTP versions
- Maintain exact feature parity with the current actor-based system (see Feature Parity Matrix below)
- Eliminate HTTP/1.0 integration test flakiness (target: 20/20 green runs of 77 H10 tests)
- Remove all dead reconnection code (`ReconnectInterval`, `MaxReconnectAttempts`, `DoReconnect`, `AttemptReconnect`)
- Delete 10 files, create 4 files — net reduction in code and complexity
- All existing tests pass (860 StreamTests, 89+ IntegrationTests, 3461 UnitTests)

### TASK-026-004: Create ConnectionPool + HostConnections
**Description:** As a developer, I want a thread-safe `ConnectionPool` with per-host `HostConnections` that handles connection acquisition (new or reused), release (back to pool or dispose), idle eviction, per-host limits, and MRU selection — replacing PoolRouter + HostPool + PerHostConnectionLimiter + ConnectionState.

  - HTTP/1.0: always `DirectConnectionFactory.EstablishAsync` (no reuse)
  - HTTP/1.1: try idle queue first, else establish new (respect limiter)
  - HTTP/2: find lease with available stream slot (MRU), else establish new
- [x] Version-aware release:
  - HTTP/1.0: always dispose
  - HTTP/1.1: if `canReuse` → enqueue to idle; else dispose + release limiter
  - HTTP/2: decrement stream count; dispose only when last stream completes AND non-reusable
- [x] Idle eviction: remove leases older than `IdleTimeout`, keep at least 1 per host
- [x] Metrics: `ConnectionActive` +/-, `ConnectionIdle` +/- on state transitions
- [x] Tests: `AcquireAsync_Http10_AlwaysCreatesNew`, `AcquireAsync_Http11_ReusesIdle`, `AcquireAsync_Http2_MultiplexesOnSame`, `Release_CanReuse_ReturnsToIdle`, `Release_CannotReuse_Disposes`, `EvictIdle_RemovesExpired`, `EvictIdle_KeepsAtLeastOne`, `AcquireAsync_PerHostLimit_Blocks`, `SelectMru_ReturnsLatestActive`

### TASK-026-006: Rewire ConnectionStage + pipeline

**Token Estimate:** ~50k tokens
**Predecessors:** TASK-026-006
**Successors:** TASK-026-008

## Functional Requirements

- FR-1: `ConnectionPool.AcquireAsync()` must return a `ConnectionLease` with working `OutboundWriter`/`InboundReader` channels for any HTTP version (1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 3.0)
- FR-2: HTTP/1.0 connections must never be reused — each `AcquireAsync` creates a fresh TCP connection
- FR-3: HTTP/1.1 connections with keep-alive must be returned to an idle pool on `Release(canReuse: true)` and reused by subsequent `AcquireAsync` calls to the same host:port
- FR-4: HTTP/2 connections must support multiplexed streams — `AcquireAsync` returns an existing connection if it has available stream slots (below `MaxConcurrentStreams`)
- FR-5: HTTP/3 QUIC connections must support typed stream opening (request, control, QPACK encoder) via `QuicConnectionManager.OpenStreamAsync()`
- FR-6: HTTP/3 inbound stream acceptance loop must accept server-initiated streams and notify subscribers
- FR-7: Per-host connection limit of 6 must be enforced for HTTP/1.x via `SemaphoreSlim`
- FR-8: Idle connections must be evicted after `TurboClientOptions.IdleTimeout` (default 10s), with at least 1 connection retained per host
- FR-9: MRU (Most Recently Used) selection must prefer the most recently active connection when multiple have available slots
- FR-10: `ConnectionActive`, `ConnectionIdle`, `ConnectionDuration` OpenTelemetry metrics must be emitted with `server.address` + `server.port` tags
- FR-11: `TurboHttpEventSource` events `ConnectionOpened` and `ConnectionClosed` must fire
- FR-12: `TurboHttpDiagnosticListener` events `OnConnectionOpened` and `OnConnectionClosed` must fire
- FR-13: `ConnectionStage` must use no `StageActor`, no `IActorRef`, no actor messages for connection management
- FR-14: All channel writers must be completed when a `ConnectionLease` is disposed (signals stale handles)

## Non-Goals

- No changes to the Akka.Streams pipeline topology (ExtractOptionsStage, BidiFlow chain, feature stages remain unchanged)
- No changes to the HTTP protocol stages (encoder, decoder, correlation, connection reuse evaluation)
- No changes to the `ConnectionHandle` record structure (add `CreateDirect()` factory, but keep existing constructor)
- No connection pre-warming or predictive connection establishment
- No HTTP/3 connection migration or 0-RTT optimization

## Technical Considerations

- **Thread safety:** `ConnectionPool` and `HostConnections` must be fully thread-safe. Use `ConcurrentDictionary` for host lookup, `SemaphoreSlim` for connection limits, `lock` for lease list mutations.
- **Disposal ordering:** `ConnectionLease.DisposeAsync()` must cancel CTS first (stops ByteMovers), then dispose `ClientState` (closes channels), then dispose `IClientProvider` (closes TCP/TLS stream). Order matters — CTS cancellation must propagate before channels are closed.
- **Async callbacks:** `ConnectionStage` uses `GetAsyncCallback<T>` to bridge async pool results into the stage event loop. The `ContinueWith` pattern must use `TaskContinuationOptions.ExecuteSynchronously` to minimize scheduling latency.
- **QUIC complexity:** `QuicConnectionManager` replaces actor-based BecomeStacked isolation with `SemaphoreSlim(1)`. Each stream spawn must be serialized to avoid interleaved state. The inbound acceptance loop runs as a long-lived `Task.Run`.
- **Architecture update:** After completion, update CLAUDE.md's "Pooling Layer" section to describe the new `ConnectionPool` → `HostConnections` → `DirectConnectionFactory` / `QuicConnectionManager` architecture.

## Success Metrics

- H10 integration tests: 20/20 consecutive green runs (currently ~6/10 with actor-based path)
- Connection acquisition latency: < 5ms for localhost (currently ~10-50ms due to actor scheduling)
- Zero orphaned connections or reconnection loops (current architecture has orphaned actor reconnections)
- Net file count reduction: delete 10 files, create 4 = -6 files
- Net code reduction: estimated ~500 lines less (actor boilerplate removed)

## Open Questions

*None — all design decisions resolved during the planning session.*

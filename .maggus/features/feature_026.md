# Feature 026: Phase 1 — Stability & Security (RFC Compliance Gaps)

## Introduction

Close three critical security and stability gaps identified in the RFC_STATUS_MATRIX (86/100 compliance):

1. **Header DoS Protection** — Add size/count limits to prevent memory exhaustion attacks
2. **Redirect Security** — Prevent HTTPS→HTTP downgrades and infinite redirect loops
3. **MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS Enforcement** — Respect server-advertised stream limits in HTTP/2

These fixes are prerequisites for production use. They address OWASP-relevant attack vectors and ensure RFC compliance.

### Architecture Context

- **Vision alignment:** TurboHttp aims to be a "production-ready, RFC-compliant HTTP client"
- **Components involved:**
  - `TurboHttp/Protocol/RFC1945/Http10Decoder` — HTTP/1.0 decoder
  - `TurboHttp/Protocol/RFC9112/Http11Decoder` — HTTP/1.1 decoder
  - `TurboHttp/Protocol/RFC9113/Http2Decoder` — HTTP/2 frame decoder
  - `TurboHttp/Protocol/RFC9110/RedirectHandler` — redirect following logic
  - `TurboHttp/Streams/Http20Engine` — HTTP/2 stream multiplexing engine
- **New patterns:** Introduces configurable limits (via `HttpDecoderOptions` or similar config class)
- **Architecture updates needed:** CLAUDE.md should document header limit defaults and override mechanisms

## Goals

1. **Prevent Header Exhaustion:** Reject requests with individual headers >16KB or total headers >64KB
2. **Prevent Redirect Loops:** Track redirect chain depth; reject chains >5 redirects
3. **Prevent HTTPS→HTTP Downgrades:** Block redirects from HTTPS to HTTP unless explicitly allowed
4. **Enforce HTTP/2 Concurrency:** Client respects `MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` setting from server
5. **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit + integration + edge-case coverage for all three features

## Tasks

### TASK-026-009: Implement MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS Tracking in Http20Engine
**Description:** As a developer, I want the HTTP/2 engine to track the server's MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS setting so that stream limits are enforced.

**Token Estimate:** ~30k tokens
**Predecessors:** none
**Successors:** TASK-026-010
**Parallel:** yes — can run alongside TASK-026-001, TASK-026-002, TASK-026-003, TASK-026-006

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Modify `Http20Engine` to maintain `_maxConcurrentStreams: int` (initialized to large value or 0 meaning "unlimited")
- [ ] When server sends SETTINGS frame with MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS:
  - [ ] Extract the value via `SettingsFrame.Parameters`
  - [ ] Store in `_maxConcurrentStreams`
  - [ ] Log the update (if logging available)
- [ ] Track active stream count:
  - [ ] Increment when stream transitions to "open" state
  - [ ] Decrement when stream closes (after all data sent and received)
- [ ] Expose via public property: `int MaxConcurrentStreams { get; }`
- [ ] Unit tests verify tracking behavior
- [ ] Compile with zero warnings

---

### TASK-026-010: Enforce MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS Limit in Stream Creation
**Description:** As a developer, I want the HTTP/2 engine to enforce the MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS limit so that the client doesn't violate server policy.

**Token Estimate:** ~35k tokens
**Predecessors:** TASK-026-009
**Successors:** TASK-026-011
**Parallel:** no — depends on tracking being implemented

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Modify `Http20Engine` stream creation logic (in correlation/routing stages):
  - [ ] Before creating new stream, check: `if (activeStreamCount >= _maxConcurrentStreams)`
  - [ ] If limit reached:
    - [ ] Queue request locally (in a bounded queue, max 100 pending)
    - [ ] Wait for active streams to close before advancing
    - [ ] Send queued requests as streams complete
- [ ] Handle edge cases:
  - [ ] Server sends MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS = 1 → only 1 stream open at a time
  - [ ] Server updates MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS mid-connection → adjust queue/backpressure
  - [ ] Request timeout while waiting in queue → reject request with timeout error
- [ ] Backpressure:
  - [ ] If queue reaches max (100), reject new requests with "Connection limit exceeded"
- [ ] Unit tests verify enforcement and queueing
- [ ] Compile with zero warnings

### TASK-026-011: Unit & Integration Tests — MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS Enforcement
**Description:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests so that MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS enforcement is verified.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create `src/TurboHttp.Tests/RFC9113/NN_Http2MaxConcurrentStreamsTests.cs` with 20+ test cases
  - [ ] Tracking: SETTINGS frame with MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS = 5 is stored
  - [ ] Tracking: MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS = 0 means unlimited
  - [ ] Enforcement: Can create up to MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS streams
  - [ ] Enforcement: 6th stream request is queued (not sent immediately)
  - [ ] Enforcement: As stream closes, queued stream is sent
  - [ ] Enforcement: Multiple streams closing → multiple queued streams sent
  - [ ] Enforcement: Request timeout while queued → rejected with timeout
  - [ ] Enforcement: Queue fills (100 pending) → new requests rejected
  - [ ] Server updates MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS mid-connection → adjust behavior
- [ ] Create Kestrel H2 integration test:
  - [ ] Server advertises MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS = 3
  - [ ] Send 5 concurrent requests
  - [ ] Verify first 3 sent immediately, 4-5 queued
  - [ ] Verify as responses arrive, queued requests are sent
  - [ ] Verify all 5 complete successfully
- [ ] All tests use `[Fact(Timeout = 10000)]` (may need longer timeout for queueing tests)
- [ ] All tests have clear `DisplayName` with RFC 9113 §5.1.2 reference
- [ ] Run via `dotnet test src/TurboHttp.Tests` — all passing

## Functional Requirements

1. **FR-1:** HTTP/1.0 decoder SHALL validate header size (single header ≤ 16KB, total ≤ 64KB) and reject with `HttpDecoderException` if exceeded
2. **FR-2:** HTTP/1.1 decoder SHALL validate header size with same limits as HTTP/1.0, excluding body data
3. **FR-3:** HTTP/2 decoder SHALL validate decompressed header block size (single ≤ 16KB, total ≤ 64KB) and reject with `Http2Exception` (FRAME_SIZE_ERROR) if exceeded
4. **FR-4:** Limits SHALL be configurable via `HttpDecoderOptions` with sensible defaults (16KB/64KB)
5. **FR-5:** Redirect handler SHALL block HTTPS→HTTP redirects by default and require explicit `AllowHttpDowngrade` flag to allow
6. **FR-6:** Redirect handler SHALL track visited URLs and reject chains that revisit the same URL or exceed 5 redirects
7. **FR-7:** HTTP/2 engine SHALL extract `MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` from SETTINGS frame and store it
8. **FR-8:** HTTP/2 engine SHALL enforce `MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` by queueing requests that exceed the limit, releasing as streams close
9. **FR-9:** All error conditions SHALL produce descriptive error messages identifying which limit was violated and (where applicable) what the limit was

---

## Non-Goals

- **No server-side implementation** — Client-side only
- **No custom header validation rules** — Only size/count limits; no content validation
- **No persistent redirect history** — Per-connection only; history is lost on new connection
- **No automatic retry on stream queue timeout** — Applications must implement retry logic
- **No changes to public API surface** — All additions are backward-compatible (new optional config parameters)
- **No deprecation of existing APIs** — All changes are additive only

---

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Fit
- **Decoder options:** All three decoders (`Http10Decoder`, `Http11Decoder`, `Http2Decoder`) need a shared `HttpDecoderOptions` config class (or three separate options classes). Consider shared base class or composition.
- **RedirectHandler:** Currently located at `TurboHttp/Protocol/RFC9110/RedirectHandler`. Ensure it has access to configuration (e.g., `AllowHttpDowngrade`, `MaxRedirectDepth`).
- **Http20Engine:** Located at `TurboHttp/Streams/Http20Engine`. Stream lifecycle and active-stream tracking must integrate with existing state machine.

### Configuration Management
- Decoders should accept `HttpDecoderOptions` in constructor or via `Configure()` method
- RedirectHandler should accept options in constructor or handler configuration
- Consider adding to `TurboHttpClientBuilder` fluent API for easy configuration:
  ```csharp
  new TurboHttpClientBuilder()
      .WithDecoderOptions(opts => opts.MaxHeaderSize = 32.Kb())
      .WithRedirectOptions(opts => opts.MaxRedirectDepth = 10)
      .Build()
  ```

### Backward Compatibility
- All configuration options SHALL have sensible defaults (16KB/64KB headers, 5 redirect limit, no downgrade allowed)
- Existing code without configuration SHALL work unchanged
- Decoder behavior change (rejecting oversized headers) is a **breaking change** semantically but NOT in API (same exceptions, just thrown in new cases)

### Error Handling
- `HttpDecoderException` — for decoder violations
- `Http2Exception` with `ErrorCode = FRAME_SIZE_ERROR` — for HTTP/2 violations
- `RedirectException` — for redirect policy violations (consider creating this if it doesn't exist)

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests:** Per-decoder, per-feature (doS, redirects, concurrent streams)
- **Integration tests:** Real Kestrel server with routes that trigger limits
- **Interop tests:** None required for Phase 1 (no HTTP/3 yet)
- **Performance impact:** Should be negligible (limit checks are O(1) or O(n) where n = header count)

---

## Success Metrics

1. **Security:** Zero DoS attacks possible via oversized headers, downgrade attacks, or redirect loops
2. **Compliance:** RFC 9113 §5.1.2 (MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS), RFC 9110 §15.4.6 (redirect security), RFC 9110 §5 (header limits) all satisfied
3. **Stability:** No memory leaks or connection hangs when limits are reached
4. **Usability:** Clear error messages when limits violated; easy configuration for non-default limits
5. **Testing:** ≥ 50 unit tests + 5+ integration tests, all passing
6. **Performance:** <1% latency impact from limit checking; measured before/after benchmarks

---

## Open Questions

1. **Header Limits — Configurability:**
   - Should limits be global (all decoders use same `HttpDecoderOptions`) or per-decoder?
   - Should limits be configurable per-request (via `HttpRequestMessage.Options`)?
   - **Current assumption:** Global defaults, configurable at client builder level

2. **Redirect Configuration — Scope:**
   - Should `AllowHttpDowngrade` be a global client setting
   - Should `MaxRedirectDepth` be configurable, or is 5 hard-coded?
   - **Current assumption:** Both are global client settings

3. **MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS — Backpressure:**
   - When queue reaches 100 pending requests, should we:
     - (A) Reject new requests with exception (current assumption)?
     - (B) Wait indefinitely (could cause deadlock)?
     - (C) Expose queue depth to application (let application decide)?
   - **Current assumption:** Option A (reject with clear error)

4. **Error Type — Redirect Violations:**
   - Should redirect policy violations throw `RedirectException` (new) or `HttpRequestException`?
   - **Current assumption:** New `RedirectException` type (more specific)

5. **Testing — Kestrel Routes:**
   - Kestrel has 60+ routes. Should we add new ones or reuse existing?
   - **Current assumption:** Add targeted new routes (oversized headers, loop redirects, max streams)

---

## Implementation Notes

- **Prerequisite:** Ensure `HttpDecoderOptions` or similar config class exists or is created first
- **Order:** Implement header limits (1-5) before redirect security (6-8) before concurrency (9-11), as they're independent branches
- **Testing:** Parallelize test writing (4, 8, 11) with implementation
- **Documentation:** Update CLAUDE.md with configuration examples and default limits once complete

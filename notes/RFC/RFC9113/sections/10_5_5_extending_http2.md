## 5.5.  Extending HTTP/2

## 5.5  Extending HTTP/2

   HTTP/2 permits extension of the protocol.  Within the limitations
   described in this section, protocol extensions can be used to provide
   additional services or alter any aspect of the protocol.  Extensions
   are effective only within the scope of a single HTTP/2 connection.

   This applies to the protocol elements defined in this document.  This
   does not affect the existing options for extending HTTP, such as
   defining new methods, status codes, or fields (see Section 16 of
   [HTTP]).

   Extensions are permitted to use new frame types (Section 4.1), new
   settings (Section 6.5), or new error codes (Section 7).  Registries
   for managing these extension points are defined in Section 11 of
   [RFC7540].

> **MUST**: Implementations MUST ignore unknown or unsupported values in all
   extensible protocol elements.  Implementations MUST discard frames
   that have unknown or unsupported types.  This means that any of these
   extension points can be safely used by extensions without prior
   arrangement or negotiation.  However, extension frames that appear in
   the middle of a field block (Section 4.3) are not permitted; these
> **MUST**: MUST be treated as a connection error (Section 5.4.1) of type
   PROTOCOL_ERROR.

> **SHOULD**: Extensions SHOULD avoid changing protocol elements defined in this
   document or elements for which no extension mechanism is defined.
   This includes changes to the layout of frames, additions or changes
   to the way that frames are composed into HTTP messages (Section 8.1),
   the definition of pseudo-header fields, or changes to any protocol
   element that a compliant endpoint might treat as a connection error
   (Section 5.4.1).

> **MUST**: An extension that changes existing protocol elements or state MUST be
   negotiated before being used.  For example, an extension that changes
   the layout of the HEADERS frame cannot be used until the peer has
   given a positive signal that this is acceptable.  In this case, it
   could also be necessary to coordinate when the revised layout comes
   into effect.  For example, treating frames other than DATA frames as
   flow controlled requires a change in semantics that both endpoints
   need to understand, so this can only be done through negotiation.

   This document doesn't mandate a specific method for negotiating the
   use of an extension but notes that a setting (Section 6.5.2) could be
   used for that purpose.  If both peers set a value that indicates
   willingness to use the extension, then the extension can be used.  If
> **MUST**: a setting is used for extension negotiation, the initial value MUST
   be defined in such a fashion that the extension is initially
   disabled.

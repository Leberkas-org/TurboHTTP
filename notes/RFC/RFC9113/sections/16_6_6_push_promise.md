## 6.6.  PUSH_PROMISE

## 6.6  PUSH_PROMISE

   The PUSH_PROMISE frame (type=0x05) is used to notify the peer
   endpoint in advance of streams the sender intends to initiate.  The
   PUSH_PROMISE frame includes the unsigned 31-bit identifier of the
   stream the endpoint plans to create along with a field section that
   provides additional context for the stream.  Section 8.4 contains a
   thorough description of the use of PUSH_PROMISE frames.

   PUSH_PROMISE Frame {
     Length (24),
     Type (8) = 0x05,

     Unused Flags (4),
     PADDED Flag (1),
     END_HEADERS Flag (1),
     Unused Flags (2),

     Reserved (1),
     Stream Identifier (31),

     [Pad Length (8)],
     Reserved (1),
     Promised Stream ID (31),
     Field Block Fragment (..),
     Padding (..2040),
   }

                    Figure 8: PUSH_PROMISE Frame Format

   The Length, Type, Unused Flag(s), Reserved, and Stream Identifier
   fields are described in Section 4.  The PUSH_PROMISE frame payload
   has the following additional fields:

   Pad Length:  An 8-bit field containing the length of the frame
      padding in units of octets.  This field is only present if the
      PADDED flag is set.

   Promised Stream ID:  An unsigned 31-bit integer that identifies the
      stream that is reserved by the PUSH_PROMISE.  The promised stream
> **MUST**: identifier MUST be a valid choice for the next stream sent by the
      sender (see "new stream identifier" in Section 5.1.1).

   Field Block Fragment:  A field block fragment (Section 4.3)
      containing the request control data and a header section.

   Padding:  Padding octets that contain no application semantic value.
> **MUST**: Padding octets MUST be set to zero when sending.  A receiver is
   not obligated to verify padding but MAY treat non-zero padding as
      a connection error (Section 5.4.1) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The PUSH_PROMISE frame defines the following flags:

   PADDED (0x08):  When set, the PADDED flag indicates that the Pad
      Length field and any padding that it describes are present.

   END_HEADERS (0x04):  When set, the END_HEADERS flag indicates that
      this frame contains an entire field block (Section 4.3) and is not
      followed by any CONTINUATION frames.

> **MUST**: A PUSH_PROMISE frame without the END_HEADERS flag set MUST be
      followed by a CONTINUATION frame for the same stream.  A receiver
> **MUST**: MUST treat the receipt of any other type of frame or a frame on a
      different stream as a connection error (Section 5.4.1) of type
      PROTOCOL_ERROR.

> **MUST**: PUSH_PROMISE frames MUST only be sent on a peer-initiated stream that
   is in either the "open" or "half-closed (remote)" state.  The stream
   identifier of a PUSH_PROMISE frame indicates the stream it is
   associated with.  If the Stream Identifier field specifies the value
> **MUST**: 0x00, a recipient MUST respond with a connection error
   (Section 5.4.1) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   Promised streams are not required to be used in the order they are
   promised.  The PUSH_PROMISE only reserves stream identifiers for
   later use.

> **MUST NOT**: PUSH_PROMISE MUST NOT be sent if the SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH setting of
   the peer endpoint is set to 0.  An endpoint that has set this setting
> **MUST**: and has received acknowledgment MUST treat the receipt of a
   PUSH_PROMISE frame as a connection error (Section 5.4.1) of type
   PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   Recipients of PUSH_PROMISE frames can choose to reject promised
   streams by returning a RST_STREAM referencing the promised stream
   identifier back to the sender of the PUSH_PROMISE.

   A PUSH_PROMISE frame modifies the connection state in two ways.
   First, the inclusion of a field block (Section 4.3) potentially
   modifies the state maintained for field section compression.  Second,
   PUSH_PROMISE also reserves a stream for later use, causing the
   promised stream to enter the "reserved (local)" or "reserved
> **MUST NOT**: (remote)" state.  A sender MUST NOT send a PUSH_PROMISE on a stream
   unless that stream is either "open" or "half-closed (remote)"; the
> **MUST**: sender MUST ensure that the promised stream is a valid choice for a
   new stream identifier (Section 5.1.1) (that is, the promised stream
> **MUST**: MUST be in the "idle" state).

   Since PUSH_PROMISE reserves a stream, ignoring a PUSH_PROMISE frame
> **MUST**: causes the stream state to become indeterminate.  A receiver MUST
   treat the receipt of a PUSH_PROMISE on a stream that is neither
   "open" nor "half-closed (local)" as a connection error
   (Section 5.4.1) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.  However, an endpoint that
> **MUST**: has sent RST_STREAM on the associated stream MUST handle PUSH_PROMISE
   frames that might have been created before the RST_STREAM frame is
   received and processed.

> **MUST**: A receiver MUST treat the receipt of a PUSH_PROMISE that promises an
   illegal stream identifier (Section 5.1.1) as a connection error
   (Section 5.4.1) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.  Note that an illegal stream
   identifier is an identifier for a stream that is not currently in the
   "idle" state.

   The total number of padding octets is determined by the value of the
   Pad Length field.  If the length of the padding is the length of the
> **MUST**: frame payload or greater, the recipient MUST treat this as a
   connection error (Section 5.4.1) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

      |  Note: A frame can be increased in size by one octet by
      |  including a Pad Length field with a value of zero.

## 6.2.  HEADERS

## 6.2  HEADERS

   The HEADERS frame (type=0x01) is used to open a stream (Section 5.1),
   and additionally carries a field block fragment.  Despite the name, a
   HEADERS frame can carry a header section or a trailer section.
   HEADERS frames can be sent on a stream in the "idle", "reserved
   (local)", "open", or "half-closed (remote)" state.

   HEADERS Frame {
     Length (24),
     Type (8) = 0x01,

     Unused Flags (2),
     PRIORITY Flag (1),
     Unused Flag (1),
     PADDED Flag (1),
     END_HEADERS Flag (1),
     Unused Flag (1),
     END_STREAM Flag (1),

     Reserved (1),
     Stream Identifier (31),

     [Pad Length (8)],
     [Exclusive (1)],
     [Stream Dependency (31)],
     [Weight (8)],
     Field Block Fragment (..),
     Padding (..2040),
   }

   The Length, Type, Unused Flag(s), Reserved, and Stream Identifier
   fields are described in Section 4.  The HEADERS frame payload has the
   following additional fields:

   Pad Length:  An 8-bit field containing the length of the frame
      padding in units of octets.  This field is only present if the
      PADDED flag is set.

   Exclusive:  A single-bit flag.  This field is only present if the
      PRIORITY flag is set.  Priority signals in HEADERS frames are
      deprecated; see Section 5.3.2.

   Stream Dependency:  A 31-bit stream identifier.  This field is only
      present if the PRIORITY flag is set.

   Weight:  An unsigned 8-bit integer.  This field is only present if
      the PRIORITY flag is set.

   Field Block Fragment:  A field block fragment (Section 4.3).

   Padding:  Padding octets that contain no application semantic value.
> **MUST**: Padding octets MUST be set to zero when sending.  A receiver is
   not obligated to verify padding but MAY treat non-zero padding as
      a connection error (Section 5.4.1) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The HEADERS frame defines the following flags:

   PRIORITY (0x20):  When set, the PRIORITY flag indicates that the
      Exclusive, Stream Dependency, and Weight fields are present.

   PADDED (0x08):  When set, the PADDED flag indicates that the Pad
      Length field and any padding that it describes are present.

   END_HEADERS (0x04):  When set, the END_HEADERS flag indicates that
      this frame contains an entire field block (Section 4.3) and is not
      followed by any CONTINUATION frames.

> **MUST**: A HEADERS frame without the END_HEADERS flag set MUST be followed
   by a CONTINUATION frame for the same stream.  A receiver MUST
      treat the receipt of any other type of frame or a frame on a
      different stream as a connection error (Section 5.4.1) of type
      PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   END_STREAM (0x01):  When set, the END_STREAM flag indicates that the
      field block (Section 4.3) is the last that the endpoint will send
      for the identified stream.

      A HEADERS frame with the END_STREAM flag set signals the end of a
      stream.  However, a HEADERS frame with the END_STREAM flag set can
      be followed by CONTINUATION frames on the same stream.  Logically,
      the CONTINUATION frames are part of the HEADERS frame.

   The frame payload of a HEADERS frame contains a field block fragment
   (Section 4.3).  A field block that does not fit within a HEADERS
   frame is continued in a CONTINUATION frame (Section 6.10).

> **MUST**: HEADERS frames MUST be associated with a stream.  If a HEADERS frame
   is received whose Stream Identifier field is 0x00, the recipient MUST
   respond with a connection error (Section 5.4.1) of type
   PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The HEADERS frame changes the connection state as described in
   Section 4.3.

   The total number of padding octets is determined by the value of the
   Pad Length field.  If the length of the padding is the length of the
> **MUST**: frame payload or greater, the recipient MUST treat this as a
   connection error (Section 5.4.1) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

      |  Note: A frame can be increased in size by one octet by
      |  including a Pad Length field with a value of zero.

## 6.10.  CONTINUATION

## 6.10  CONTINUATION

   The CONTINUATION frame (type=0x09) is used to continue a sequence of
   field block fragments (Section 4.3).  Any number of CONTINUATION
   frames can be sent, as long as the preceding frame is on the same
   stream and is a HEADERS, PUSH_PROMISE, or CONTINUATION frame without
   the END_HEADERS flag set.

   CONTINUATION Frame {
     Length (24),
     Type (8) = 0x09,

     Unused Flags (5),
     END_HEADERS Flag (1),
     Unused Flags (2),

     Reserved (1),
     Stream Identifier (31),

     Field Block Fragment (..),
   }

                    Figure 12: CONTINUATION Frame Format

   The Length, Type, Unused Flag(s), Reserved, and Stream Identifier
   fields are described in Section 4.  The CONTINUATION frame payload
   contains a field block fragment (Section 4.3).

   The CONTINUATION frame defines the following flag:

   END_HEADERS (0x04):  When set, the END_HEADERS flag indicates that
      this frame ends a field block (Section 4.3).

> **MUST**: If the END_HEADERS flag is not set, this frame MUST be followed by
   another CONTINUATION frame.  A receiver MUST treat the receipt of
      any other type of frame or a frame on a different stream as a
      connection error (Section 5.4.1) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The CONTINUATION frame changes the connection state as defined in
   Section 4.3.

> **MUST**: CONTINUATION frames MUST be associated with a stream.  If a
   CONTINUATION frame is received with a Stream Identifier field of
> **MUST**: 0x00, the recipient MUST respond with a connection error
   (Section 5.4.1) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

> **MUST**: A CONTINUATION frame MUST be preceded by a HEADERS, PUSH_PROMISE or
   CONTINUATION frame without the END_HEADERS flag set.  A recipient
> **MUST**: that observes violation of this rule MUST respond with a connection
   error (Section 5.4.1) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

## 6.3.  PRIORITY

## 6.3  PRIORITY

   The PRIORITY frame (type=0x02) is deprecated; see Section 5.3.2.  A
   PRIORITY frame can be sent in any stream state, including idle or
   closed streams.

   PRIORITY Frame {
     Length (24) = 0x05,
     Type (8) = 0x02,

     Unused Flags (8),

     Reserved (1),
     Stream Identifier (31),

     Exclusive (1),
     Stream Dependency (31),
     Weight (8),
   }

                      Figure 5: PRIORITY Frame Format

   The Length, Type, Unused Flag(s), Reserved, and Stream Identifier
   fields are described in Section 4.  The frame payload of a PRIORITY
   frame contains the following additional fields:

   Exclusive:  A single-bit flag.

   Stream Dependency:  A 31-bit stream identifier.

   Weight:  An unsigned 8-bit integer.

   The PRIORITY frame does not define any flags.

   The PRIORITY frame always identifies a stream.  If a PRIORITY frame
> **MUST**: is received with a stream identifier of 0x00, the recipient MUST
   respond with a connection error (Section 5.4.1) of type
   PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   Sending or receiving a PRIORITY frame does not affect the state of
   any stream (Section 5.1).  The PRIORITY frame can be sent on a stream
   in any state, including "idle" or "closed".  A PRIORITY frame cannot
   be sent between consecutive frames that comprise a single field block
   (Section 4.3).

> **MUST**: A PRIORITY frame with a length other than 5 octets MUST be treated as
   a stream error (Section 5.4.2) of type FRAME_SIZE_ERROR.

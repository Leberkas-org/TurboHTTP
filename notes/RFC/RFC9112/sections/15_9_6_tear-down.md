## 9.6.  Tear-down

## 9.6  Tear-down

   The "close" connection option is defined as a signal that the sender
   will close this connection after completion of the response.  A
> **SHOULD**: sender SHOULD send a Connection header field (Section 7.6.1 of
   [HTTP]) containing the "close" connection option when it intends to
   close a connection.  For example,

   Connection: close

   as a request header field indicates that this is the last request
   that the client will send on this connection, while in a response,
   the same field indicates that the server is going to close this
   connection after the response message is complete.

   Note that the field name "Close" is reserved, since using that name
   as a header field might conflict with the "close" connection option.

> **MUST NOT**: A client that sends a "close" connection option MUST NOT send further
   requests on that connection (after the one containing the "close")
> **MUST**: and MUST close the connection after reading the final response
   message corresponding to this request.

> **MUST**: A server that receives a "close" connection option MUST initiate
   closure of the connection (see below) after it sends the final
   response to the request that contained the "close" connection option.
> **SHOULD**: The server SHOULD send a "close" connection option in its final
   response on that connection.  The server MUST NOT process any further
   requests received on that connection.

> **MUST**: A server that sends a "close" connection option MUST initiate closure
   of the connection (see below) after it sends the response containing
> **MUST NOT**: the "close" connection option.  The server MUST NOT process any
   further requests received on that connection.

> **MUST**: A client that receives a "close" connection option MUST cease sending
   requests on that connection and close the connection after reading
   the response message containing the "close" connection option; if
   additional pipelined requests had been sent on the connection, the
> **SHOULD NOT**: client SHOULD NOT assume that they will be processed by the server.

   If a server performs an immediate close of a TCP connection, there is
   a significant risk that the client will not be able to read the last
   HTTP response.  If the server receives additional data from the
   client on a fully closed connection, such as another request sent by
   the client before receiving the server's response, the server's TCP
   stack will send a reset packet to the client; unfortunately, the
   reset packet might erase the client's unacknowledged input buffers
   before they can be read and interpreted by the client's HTTP parser.

   To avoid the TCP reset problem, servers typically close a connection
   in stages.  First, the server performs a half-close by closing only
   the write side of the read/write connection.  The server then
   continues to read from the connection until it receives a
   corresponding close by the client, or until the server is reasonably
   certain that its own TCP stack has received the client's
   acknowledgement of the packet(s) containing the server's last
   response.  Finally, the server fully closes the connection.

   It is unknown whether the reset problem is exclusive to TCP or might
   also be found in other transport connection protocols.

   Note that a TCP connection that is half-closed by the client does not
   delimit a request message, nor does it imply that the client is no
   longer interested in a response.  In general, transport signals
   cannot be relied upon to signal edge cases, since HTTP/1.1 is
   independent of transport.

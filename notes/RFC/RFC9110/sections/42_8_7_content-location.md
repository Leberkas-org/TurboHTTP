## 8.7.  Content-Location

## 8.7  Content-Location

   The "Content-Location" header field references a URI that can be used
   as an identifier for a specific resource corresponding to the
   representation in this message's content.  In other words, if one
   were to perform a GET request on this URI at the time of this
   message's generation, then a 200 (OK) response would contain the same
   representation that is enclosed as content in this message.


```abnf
     Content-Location = absolute-URI / partial-URI
```


   The field value is either an absolute-URI or a partial-URI.  In the
   latter case (Section 4), the referenced URI is relative to the target
   URI ([URI], Section 5).

   The Content-Location value is not a replacement for the target URI
   (Section 7.1).  It is representation metadata.  It has the same
   syntax and semantics as the header field of the same name defined for
   MIME body parts in Section 4 of [RFC2557].  However, its appearance
   in an HTTP message has some special implications for HTTP recipients.

   If Content-Location is included in a 2xx (Successful) response
   message and its value refers (after conversion to absolute form) to a
> **MAY**: URI that is the same as the target URI, then the recipient MAY
   consider the content to be a current representation of that resource
   at the time indicated by the message origination date.  For a GET
   (Section 9.3.1) or HEAD (Section 9.3.2) request, this is the same as
   the default semantics when no Content-Location is provided by the
   server.  For a state-changing request like PUT (Section 9.3.4) or
   POST (Section 9.3.3), it implies that the server's response contains
   the new representation of that resource, thereby distinguishing it
   from representations that might only report about the action (e.g.,
   "It worked!").  This allows authoring applications to update their
   local copies without the need for a subsequent GET request.

   If Content-Location is included in a 2xx (Successful) response
   message and its field value refers to a URI that differs from the
   target URI, then the origin server claims that the URI is an
   identifier for a different resource corresponding to the enclosed
   representation.  Such a claim can only be trusted if both identifiers
   share the same resource owner, which cannot be programmatically
   determined via HTTP.

   *  For a response to a GET or HEAD request, this is an indication
      that the target URI refers to a resource that is subject to
      content negotiation and the Content-Location field value is a more
      specific identifier for the selected representation.

   *  For a 201 (Created) response to a state-changing method, a
      Content-Location field value that is identical to the Location
      field value indicates that this content is a current
      representation of the newly created resource.

   *  Otherwise, such a Content-Location indicates that this content is
      a representation reporting on the requested action's status and
      that the same report is available (for future access with GET) at
      the given URI.  For example, a purchase transaction made via a
      POST request might include a receipt document as the content of
      the 200 (OK) response; the Content-Location field value provides
      an identifier for retrieving a copy of that same receipt in the
      future.

   A user agent that sends Content-Location in a request message is
   stating that its value refers to where the user agent originally
   obtained the content of the enclosed representation (prior to any
   modifications made by that user agent).  In other words, the user
   agent is providing a back link to the source of the original
   representation.

   An origin server that receives a Content-Location field in a request
> **MUST**: message MUST treat the information as transitory request context
   rather than as metadata to be saved verbatim as part of the
> **MAY**: representation.  An origin server MAY use that context to guide in
   processing the request or to save it for other uses, such as within
> **MUST**: source links or versioning metadata.  However, an origin server MUST
   NOT use such context information to alter the request semantics.

   For example, if a client makes a PUT request on a negotiated resource
   and the origin server accepts that PUT (without redirection), then
   the new state of that resource is expected to be consistent with the
   one representation supplied in that PUT; the Content-Location cannot
   be used as a form of reverse content selection identifier to update
   only one of the negotiated representations.  If the user agent had
   wanted the latter semantics, it would have applied the PUT directly
   to the Content-Location URI.

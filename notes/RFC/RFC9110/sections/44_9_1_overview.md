9.  Methods

## 9.1  Overview

   The request method token is the primary source of request semantics;
   it indicates the purpose for which the client has made this request
   and what is expected by the client as a successful result.

   The request method's semantics might be further specialized by the
   semantics of some header fields when present in a request if those
   additional semantics do not conflict with the method.  For example, a
   client can send conditional request header fields (Section 13.1) to
   make the requested action conditional on the current state of the
   target resource.

   HTTP is designed to be usable as an interface to distributed object
   systems.  The request method invokes an action to be applied to a
   target resource in much the same way that a remote method invocation
   can be sent to an identified object.


```abnf
     method = token
```


   The method token is case-sensitive because it might be used as a
   gateway to object-based systems with case-sensitive method names.  By
   convention, standardized methods are defined in all-uppercase US-
   ASCII letters.

   Unlike distributed objects, the standardized request methods in HTTP
   are not resource-specific, since uniform interfaces provide for
   better visibility and reuse in network-based systems [REST].  Once
   defined, a standardized method ought to have the same semantics when
   applied to any resource, though each resource determines for itself
   whether those semantics are implemented or allowed.

   This specification defines a number of standardized methods that are
   commonly used in HTTP, as outlined by the following table.

   +=========+============================================+=========+
   | Method  | Description                                | Section |
   | Name    |                                            |         |
   +=========+============================================+=========+
   | GET     | Transfer a current representation of the   | 9.3.1   |
   |         | target resource.                           |         |
   +---------+--------------------------------------------+---------+
   | HEAD    | Same as GET, but do not transfer the       | 9.3.2   |
   |         | response content.                          |         |
   +---------+--------------------------------------------+---------+
   | POST    | Perform resource-specific processing on    | 9.3.3   |
   |         | the request content.                       |         |
   +---------+--------------------------------------------+---------+
   | PUT     | Replace all current representations of the | 9.3.4   |
   |         | target resource with the request content.  |         |
   +---------+--------------------------------------------+---------+
   | DELETE  | Remove all current representations of the  | 9.3.5   |
   |         | target resource.                           |         |
   +---------+--------------------------------------------+---------+
   | CONNECT | Establish a tunnel to the server           | 9.3.6   |
   |         | identified by the target resource.         |         |
   +---------+--------------------------------------------+---------+
   | OPTIONS | Describe the communication options for the | 9.3.7   |
   |         | target resource.                           |         |
   +---------+--------------------------------------------+---------+
   | TRACE   | Perform a message loop-back test along the | 9.3.8   |
   |         | path to the target resource.               |         |
   +---------+--------------------------------------------+---------+

                                Table 4

> **MUST**: All general-purpose servers MUST support the methods GET and HEAD.
   All other methods are OPTIONAL.

   The set of methods allowed by a target resource can be listed in an
   Allow header field (Section 10.2.1).  However, the set of allowed
   methods can change dynamically.  An origin server that receives a
> **SHOULD**: request method that is unrecognized or not implemented SHOULD respond
   with the 501 (Not Implemented) status code.  An origin server that
   receives a request method that is recognized and implemented, but not
> **SHOULD**: allowed for the target resource, SHOULD respond with the 405 (Method
   Not Allowed) status code.

   Additional methods, outside the scope of this specification, have
   been specified for use in HTTP.  All such methods ought to be
   registered within the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Method
   Registry", as described in Section 16.1.

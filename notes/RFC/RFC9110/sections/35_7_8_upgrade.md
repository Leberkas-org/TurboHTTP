## 7.8.  Upgrade

## 7.8  Upgrade

   The "Upgrade" header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism
   for transitioning from HTTP/1.1 to some other protocol on the same
   connection.

> **MAY**: A client MAY send a list of protocol names in the Upgrade header
   field of a request to invite the server to switch to one or more of
   the named protocols, in order of descending preference, before
> **MAY**: sending the final response.  A server MAY ignore a received Upgrade
   header field if it wishes to continue using the current protocol on
   that connection.  Upgrade cannot be used to insist on a protocol
   change.


```abnf
     Upgrade          = #protocol

     protocol         = protocol-name ["/" protocol-version]
     protocol-name    = token
     protocol-version = token
```


   Although protocol names are registered with a preferred case,
> **SHOULD**: recipients SHOULD use case-insensitive comparison when matching each
   protocol-name to supported protocols.

> **MUST**: A server that sends a 101 (Switching Protocols) response MUST send an
   Upgrade header field to indicate the new protocol(s) to which the
   connection is being switched; if multiple protocol layers are being
> **MUST**: switched, the sender MUST list the protocols in layer-ascending
   order.  A server MUST NOT switch to a protocol that was not indicated
   by the client in the corresponding request's Upgrade header field.  A
> **MAY**: server MAY choose to ignore the order of preference indicated by the
   client and select the new protocol(s) based on other factors, such as
   the nature of the request or the current load on the server.

> **MUST**: A server that sends a 426 (Upgrade Required) response MUST send an
   Upgrade header field to indicate the acceptable protocols, in order
   of descending preference.

> **MAY**: A server MAY send an Upgrade header field in any other response to
   advertise that it implements support for upgrading to the listed
   protocols, in order of descending preference, when appropriate for a
   future request.

   The following is a hypothetical example sent by a client:

   GET /hello HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.com
   Connection: upgrade
   Upgrade: websocket, IRC/6.9, RTA/x11

   The capabilities and nature of the application-level communication
   after the protocol change is entirely dependent upon the new
   protocol(s) chosen.  However, immediately after sending the 101
   (Switching Protocols) response, the server is expected to continue
   responding to the original request as if it had received its
   equivalent within the new protocol (i.e., the server still has an
   outstanding request to satisfy after the protocol has been changed,
   and is expected to do so without requiring the request to be
   repeated).

   For example, if the Upgrade header field is received in a GET request
   and the server decides to switch protocols, it first responds with a
   101 (Switching Protocols) message in HTTP/1.1 and then immediately
   follows that with the new protocol's equivalent of a response to a
   GET on the target resource.  This allows a connection to be upgraded
   to protocols with the same semantics as HTTP without the latency cost
> **MUST NOT**: of an additional round trip.  A server MUST NOT switch protocols
   unless the received message semantics can be honored by the new
   protocol; an OPTIONS request can be honored by any protocol.

   The following is an example response to the above hypothetical
   request:

   HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
   Connection: upgrade
   Upgrade: websocket

   [... data stream switches to websocket with an appropriate response
   (as defined by new protocol) to the "GET /hello" request ...]

> **MUST**: A sender of Upgrade MUST also send an "Upgrade" connection option in
   the Connection header field (Section 7.6.1) to inform intermediaries
   not to forward this field.  A server that receives an Upgrade header
> **MUST**: field in an HTTP/1.0 request MUST ignore that Upgrade field.

   A client cannot begin using an upgraded protocol on the connection
   until it has completely sent the request message (i.e., the client
   can't change the protocol it is sending in the middle of a message).
   If a server receives both an Upgrade and an Expect header field with
> **MUST**: the "100-continue" expectation (Section 10.1.1), the server MUST send
   a 100 (Continue) response before sending a 101 (Switching Protocols)
   response.

   The Upgrade header field only applies to switching protocols on top
   of the existing connection; it cannot be used to switch the
   underlying connection (transport) protocol, nor to switch the
   existing communication to a different connection.  For those
   purposes, it is more appropriate to use a 3xx (Redirection) response
   (Section 15.4).

   This specification only defines the protocol name "HTTP" for use by
   the family of Hypertext Transfer Protocols, as defined by the HTTP
   version rules of Section 2.5 and future updates to this
   specification.  Additional protocol names ought to be registered
   using the registration procedure defined in Section 16.7.

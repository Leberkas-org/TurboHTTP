## 14.5.  Partial PUT

## 14.5  Partial PUT

   Some origin servers support PUT of a partial representation when the
   user agent sends a Content-Range header field (Section 14.4) in the
   request, though such support is inconsistent and depends on private
   agreements with user agents.  In general, it requests that the state
   of the target resource be partly replaced with the enclosed content
   at an offset and length indicated by the Content-Range value, where
   the offset is relative to the current selected representation.

> **SHOULD**: An origin server SHOULD respond with a 400 (Bad Request) status code
   if it receives Content-Range on a PUT for a target resource that does
   not support partial PUT requests.

   Partial PUT is not backwards compatible with the original definition
   of PUT.  It may result in the content being written as a complete
   replacement for the current representation.

   Partial resource updates are also possible by targeting a separately
   identified resource with state that overlaps or extends a portion of
   the larger resource, or by using a different method that has been
   specifically defined for partial updates (for example, the PATCH
   method defined in [RFC5789]).

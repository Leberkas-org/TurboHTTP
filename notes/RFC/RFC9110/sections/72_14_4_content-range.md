## 14.4.  Content-Range

## 14.4  Content-Range

   The "Content-Range" header field is sent in a single part 206
   (Partial Content) response to indicate the partial range of the
   selected representation enclosed as the message content, sent in each
   part of a multipart 206 response to indicate the range enclosed
   within each body part (Section 14.6), and sent in 416 (Range Not
   Satisfiable) responses to provide information about the selected
   representation.


```abnf
     Content-Range       = range-unit SP
                           ( range-resp / unsatisfied-range )

     range-resp          = incl-range "/" ( complete-length / "*" )
     incl-range          = first-pos "-" last-pos
     unsatisfied-range   = "*/" complete-length

     complete-length     = 1*DIGIT
```


   If a 206 (Partial Content) response contains a Content-Range header
   field with a range unit (Section 14.1) that the recipient does not
> **MUST NOT**: understand, the recipient MUST NOT attempt to recombine it with a
   stored representation.  A proxy that receives such a message SHOULD
   forward it downstream.

   Content-Range might also be sent as a request modifier to request a
   partial PUT, as described in Section 14.5, based on private
> **MUST**: agreements between client and origin server.  A server MUST ignore a
   Content-Range header field received in a request with a method for
   which Content-Range support is not defined.

> **SHOULD**: For byte ranges, a sender SHOULD indicate the complete length of the
   representation from which the range has been extracted, unless the
   complete length is unknown or difficult to determine.  An asterisk
   character ("*") in place of the complete-length indicates that the
   representation length was unknown when the header field was
   generated.

   The following example illustrates when the complete length of the
   selected representation is known by the sender to be 1234 bytes:

   Content-Range: bytes 42-1233/1234

   and this second example illustrates when the complete length is
   unknown:

   Content-Range: bytes 42-1233/*

   A Content-Range field value is invalid if it contains a range-resp
   that has a last-pos value less than its first-pos value, or a
   complete-length value less than or equal to its last-pos value.  The
> **MUST NOT**: recipient of an invalid Content-Range MUST NOT attempt to recombine
   the received content with a stored representation.

   A server generating a 416 (Range Not Satisfiable) response to a byte-
> **SHOULD**: range request SHOULD send a Content-Range header field with an
   unsatisfied-range value, as in the following example:

   Content-Range: bytes */1234

   The complete-length in a 416 response indicates the current length of
   the selected representation.

   The Content-Range header field has no meaning for status codes that
   do not explicitly describe its semantic.  For this specification,
   only the 206 (Partial Content) and 416 (Range Not Satisfiable) status
   codes describe a meaning for Content-Range.

   The following are examples of Content-Range values in which the
   selected representation contains a total of 1234 bytes:

   *  The first 500 bytes:

      Content-Range: bytes 0-499/1234

   *  The second 500 bytes:

      Content-Range: bytes 500-999/1234

   *  All except for the first 500 bytes:

      Content-Range: bytes 500-1233/1234

   *  The last 500 bytes:

      Content-Range: bytes 734-1233/1234

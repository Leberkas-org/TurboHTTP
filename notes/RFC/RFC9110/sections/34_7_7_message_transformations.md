## 7.7.  Message Transformations

## 7.7  Message Transformations

   Some intermediaries include features for transforming messages and
   their content.  A proxy might, for example, convert between image
   formats in order to save cache space or to reduce the amount of
   traffic on a slow link.  However, operational problems might occur
   when these transformations are applied to content intended for
   critical applications, such as medical imaging or scientific data
   analysis, particularly when integrity checks or digital signatures
   are used to ensure that the content received is identical to the
   original.

   An HTTP-to-HTTP proxy is called a "transforming proxy" if it is
   designed or configured to modify messages in a semantically
   meaningful way (i.e., modifications, beyond those required by normal
   HTTP processing, that change the message in a way that would be
   significant to the original sender or potentially significant to
   downstream recipients).  For example, a transforming proxy might be
   acting as a shared annotation server (modifying responses to include
   references to a local annotation database), a malware filter, a
   format transcoder, or a privacy filter.  Such transformations are
   presumed to be desired by whichever client (or client organization)
   chose the proxy.

   If a proxy receives a target URI with a host name that is not a fully
> **MAY**: qualified domain name, it MAY add its own domain to the host name it
   received when forwarding the request.  A proxy MUST NOT change the
   host name if the target URI contains a fully qualified domain name.

> **MUST NOT**: A proxy MUST NOT modify the "absolute-path" and "query" parts of the
   received target URI when forwarding it to the next inbound server
   except as required by that forwarding protocol.  For example, a proxy
   forwarding a request to an origin server via HTTP/1.1 will replace an
   empty path with "/" (Section 3.2.1 of [HTTP/1.1]) or "*"
   (Section 3.2.4 of [HTTP/1.1]), depending on the request method.

> **MUST NOT**: A proxy MUST NOT transform the content (Section 6.4) of a response
   message that contains a no-transform cache directive (Section 5.2.2.6
   of [CACHING]).  Note that this does not apply to message
   transformations that do not change the content, such as the addition
   or removal of transfer codings (Section 7 of [HTTP/1.1]).

> **MAY**: A proxy MAY transform the content of a message that does not contain
   a no-transform cache directive.  A proxy that transforms the content
   of a 200 (OK) response can inform downstream recipients that a
   transformation has been applied by changing the response status code
   to 203 (Non-Authoritative Information) (Section 15.3.4).

> **SHOULD NOT**: A proxy SHOULD NOT modify header fields that provide information
   about the endpoints of the communication chain, the resource state,
   or the selected representation (other than the content) unless the
   field's definition specifically allows such modification or the
   modification is deemed necessary for privacy or security.

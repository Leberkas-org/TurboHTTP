## 8.6.  Content-Length

## 8.6  Content-Length

   The "Content-Length" header field indicates the associated
   representation's data length as a decimal non-negative integer number
   of octets.  When transferring a representation as content, Content-
   Length refers specifically to the amount of data enclosed so that it
   can be used to delimit framing (e.g., Section 6.2 of [HTTP/1.1]).  In
   other cases, Content-Length indicates the selected representation's
   current length, which can be used by recipients to estimate transfer
   time or to compare with previously stored representations.


```abnf
     Content-Length = 1*DIGIT
```


   An example is

   Content-Length: 3495

> **SHOULD**: A user agent SHOULD send Content-Length in a request when the method
   defines a meaning for enclosed content and it is not sending
   Transfer-Encoding.  For example, a user agent normally sends Content-
   Length in a POST request even when the value is 0 (indicating empty
> **SHOULD NOT**: content).  A user agent SHOULD NOT send a Content-Length header field
   when the request message does not contain content and the method
   semantics do not anticipate such data.

> **MAY**: A server MAY send a Content-Length header field in a response to a
   HEAD request (Section 9.3.2); a server MUST NOT send Content-Length
   in such a response unless its field value equals the decimal number
   of octets that would have been sent in the content of a response if
   the same request had used the GET method.

> **MAY**: A server MAY send a Content-Length header field in a 304 (Not
   Modified) response to a conditional GET request (Section 15.4.5); a
> **MUST NOT**: server MUST NOT send Content-Length in such a response unless its
   field value equals the decimal number of octets that would have been
   sent in the content of a 200 (OK) response to the same request.

> **MUST NOT**: A server MUST NOT send a Content-Length header field in any response
   with a status code of 1xx (Informational) or 204 (No Content).  A
> **MUST NOT**: server MUST NOT send a Content-Length header field in any 2xx
   (Successful) response to a CONNECT request (Section 9.3.6).

   Aside from the cases defined above, in the absence of Transfer-
> **SHOULD**: Encoding, an origin server SHOULD send a Content-Length header field
   when the content size is known prior to sending the complete header
   section.  This will allow downstream recipients to measure transfer
   progress, know when a received message is complete, and potentially
   reuse the connection for additional requests.

   Any Content-Length field value greater than or equal to zero is
   valid.  Since there is no predefined limit to the length of content,
> **MUST**: a recipient MUST anticipate potentially large decimal numerals and
   prevent parsing errors due to integer conversion overflows or
   precision loss due to integer conversion (Section 17.5).

   Because Content-Length is used for message delimitation in HTTP/1.1,
   its field value can impact how the message is parsed by downstream
   recipients even when the immediate connection is not using HTTP/1.1.
   If the message is forwarded by a downstream intermediary, a Content-
   Length field value that is inconsistent with the received message
   framing might cause a security failure due to request smuggling or
   response splitting.

> **MUST NOT**: As a result, a sender MUST NOT forward a message with a Content-
   Length header field value that is known to be incorrect.

> **MUST NOT**: Likewise, a sender MUST NOT forward a message with a Content-Length
   header field value that does not match the ABNF above, with one
   exception: a recipient of a Content-Length header field value
   consisting of the same decimal value repeated as a comma-separated
> **MAY**: list (e.g, "Content-Length: 42, 42") MAY either reject the message as
   invalid or replace that invalid field value with a single instance of
   the decimal value, since this likely indicates that a duplicate was
   generated or combined by an upstream message processor.
